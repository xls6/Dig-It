# Dig It AHK Macro🪓
## 🚀 Features

### 🔧 Calibrate digging and selling pixels:
• Customize inventory threshold & movement (Lane/Square)
• Enable/disable auto-selling & enchanted hourglass

### 🚶 Movement:
• Lane: forward/back, may get stuck briefly - safer
• Square: forward, left, back, right - avoids short loops

### ⚙️ Calibration:
• For rarity pixel, start digging in-game, then click 'Set Rarity' in settings and select the colored bar.
• For sell button (gamepass), click 'Set Sell' and select the sell button.
• Set your shovel holding state properly in settings before starting.

### 💡 Tips:
• Don't try to bug the macro :)

• Recalibrate if digging indicator acts up.
