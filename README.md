# Dig It AHK Macro🪓
### _Made by makmatoe_
## 🚀 Features

### 🔧 Calibrate digging and selling pixels:
• Customize inventory threshold & movement (Lane / Square)

• Enable or disable auto-selling & enchanted hourglass

### 🚶 Movement modes:
• Lane: moves forward & back — may get stuck briefly but is safer

• Square: moves in a square (forward, left, back, right) — avoids short loops

### ⚙️ Calibration:
• For rarity pixel: start digging in-game, then click “Set Rarity” in settings and select the colored bar.

• For sell button (gamepass): click “**Set Sell**” and select the sell button.

• Set your shovel holding state properly before starting.

### 💡 Tips:
• Don’t try to break the macro 😄

• Recalibrate if the digging indicator acts up.
